    1. Send a 202 - Accepted status code in your response to Microsoft
    Graph. If Microsoft Graph doesn't receive a 2xx class code, it
    will try to publishing the change notification a number of times,
    for a period of about 4 hours; after that, the change notification
    will be dropped and won't be delivered.

      Note: Send a 202 - Accepted status code as soon as you receive
      the change notification, even before validating its
      authenticity. You are simply acknowledging the receipt of the
      change notification and preventing unnecessary retries. The
      current timeout is 30 seconds, but it might be reduced in the
      future to optimize service performance. If the notification URL
      doesn't reply within 30 seconds for more than 10% of the
      requests from Microsoft Graph over a 10 minute period, all
      following notifications will be delayed and retried for a period
      of 4 hours. If a notification URL doesn't reply within 30
      seconds for more than 20% of the requests from Microsoft Graph
      over a 10 minute period, all following notifications will be
      dropped.

    2. Validate the clientState property. It must match the value
    originally submitted with the subscription creation request.

      Note: If this isn't true, you should not consider this a valid
      change notification. It is possible that the change notification
      has not originated from Microsoft Graph and may have been sent
      by a rogue actor. You should also investigate where the change
      notification comes from and take appropriate action.

    3. Update your application based on your business logic.
